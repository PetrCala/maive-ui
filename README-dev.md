# Deploying the application

We use AWS to host the application. To host the application, please [create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) first, install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), and log in to your account in your console.

We also recommend you [create a profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) for your account.

## Initial deploy to cloud

Before the application stack can be deployed, you must first deploy the infra foundation:

1. Make sure you are logged in to the account you want to deploy the resources for. Confirm this by calling `aws sts get-caller-identity`.
1. Run `npm run cloud:init`. This will deploy the foundation infrastructure such as S3, ECR, VPC, etc.

## Deploying the app stack

The applications are built and deployed automatically upno each pull request to the `release` branch. To release a new (or initial) version of the app, simply open a pull request against the `release` branch and follow the instructions.

## Destroying the architecture

To destroy the existing architecture, simply run `npm run cloud:destroy`. This will teardown both application, and infrastructure services.

# How to run locally

## Prerequisites

- Install `node`, `Python`, `R`, `Podman` (or `Docker`),
- [Set up podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) or [Set up Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Install `podman-compose` using `brew install podman-compose`

## Steps

- Initialize the podman using `podman machine start`.
- Run `npm run start:dev`. This will build all necessary images, and start up relevant containers in a development environment. For production environment, execute `npm run start:prod` instead.
- Individual parts of the application can be accessed from your browser or from the terminal under these domains:
  - **React application:** `127.0.0.1:3000`
  - **R:** `127.0.0.1:8787`

## Notes

- You can check that the containers are up and running by calling `podman ps -a` from another terminal instance.
- Upon pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal instance where the `start:dev` command was executed, all of the running containers will be gracefully shut down and deleted.
- Any images built during the process will remain present. You can check the list of these images by running `podman images`. Remove these using `podman rmi [image-name]`, or `podman rmi -a`, which will remove all images.
- You can also access any of the containers by using `localhost` as the host name, such as `localhost:3000` for the React application.

## üîÑ Development & Releases

### Quarterly Release Automation

This project uses automated quarterly releases to ensure consistent and predictable deployment cycles. The system:

- **Automatically creates release PRs** every quarter (Jan 1, Apr 1, Jul 1, Oct 1)
- **Integrates with existing CI/CD pipeline** for seamless deployment
- **Requires manual approval** before merging (maintainer control)
- **Provides comprehensive instructions** for each release

**Learn more**: [Quarterly Release Documentation](docs/QUARTERLY_RELEASES.md)

### Testing the Release System

```bash
# Test quarterly release logic locally
bun run test-quarterly

# Test with specific quarter/year
bun run test-quarterly --quarter Q2 --year 2024

# Test version bumping logic
bun run test-quarterly --test-version
```

# Handling images containers

## Scripts

There are several pre-defined node scripts which should help you work with images and containers. All of these can be executed using `npm run [script-name]`Here is a list of some of them:

- `images:build`: Builds the Docker images only if they don't already exist.
- `images:rebuild`: Forces the rebuild of all Docker images.
- `images:rebuild-<image-tag>`: Force the rebuild of a single Docker image (specified by `<image-tag>`). E.g., `bun run images:rebuild-react` rebuilds the React image.
- `images:rename`: Renames all existing images to match the current project version.
- `start:dev`: Builds any missing images and starts up all containers in a development environment. Upon Ctrl+C, all of the containers will be gracefully shut down and deleted.
- `start:prod`: Very similar to `start:dev`, but builds and starts the containers in a production environment.
- `stop`: Stops and removes all existing containers.

# Useful notes

- Remove empty images

  ```bash
  podman images --format "{{.ID}}: {{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}" | grep '<none>' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | xargs -I {} podman rmi {}
  ```

- Get logs of a container that is running in a detached mode

  ```bash
  podman logs -f <container-name>
  ```

## Technical choices

### Front-end

- React with Next.js

### Back end

- R API endpoint through [Plumber](https://www.rplumber.io)

### CI/CD

- Containers using Podman (or Docker)

# Creating new releases

All infrastructure is built and deployed to AWS through the `release.yml` workflow.

You can trigger this by opening a PR against the `master` branch and tagging it with the `release` label. Upon successful merge, the `release.yml` workflow will be triggered.

If you want to build a new specific semver verison, pass the relevant label, i.e. `v-build`, `v-patch`, `v-minor`, or `v-major`.

To open the release PR automatically, call `npm run release`, and optionally pass the --semver flag with the desired semver level.

As admin, can also close the PRs automatically using `npm run mergePR`.

# Commit message formatting

This project uses conventional commit messages to maintain a clean and consistent git history. All commit messages must follow the conventional commit format:

```bash
<type>: <description>
```

## Allowed Types

The following types are allowed:

- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

## Rules

1. The commit message must start with one of the allowed types followed by a colon and a space
2. The total length of the commit message header (first line) must not exceed 100 characters
3. For breaking changes, include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit message

## Examples

‚úÖ Valid commit messages:

```bash
feat: add support for custom linting rules
fix: resolve authentication token expiration
docs: update API documentation
```

‚ùå Invalid commit messages:

```bash
added new feature
fixed bug
update docs
```
